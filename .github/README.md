# Project Borealis base project files
This is a skeleton framework of a bit of our project repo structure.

It contains supporting git configurations and scripts, development files
and Unreal Engine 4 configuration files, complete with optimized configuration variables
that we've used to reach our 1080p60fps target for Intel HD Graphics 4400.
