# Project Borealis Core

This is a skeleton framework of our UE project.

It contains supporting git configurations and scripts, development files
and Unreal Engine configuration files, complete with optimized configuration variables
that we've used to reach our 1080p60fps target for Intel HD Graphics 4400.
